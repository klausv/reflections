** Reflect: Initializing a Repository
* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git establishes a lot of configuration files required for the git software to track changes to the files in the repository 

** Reflect: Staging Area
* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporary directory, where you can make drafts and changes without cluttering your commit history up.  This is beneficial for tria-and-error, 
where you dont want to confuse collaborating partners, for instance.  

** Reflect: Commit Size
* How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By cumulating the modifications until you are happy to commit a logical change
