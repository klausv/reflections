** Reflect: Initializing a Repository
* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git establishes a lot of configuration files required for the git software to track changes to the files in the repository 

** Reflect: Staging Area
* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a temporary directory, where you can make drafts and changes without cluttering your commit history up.  This is beneficial for tria-and-error, 
where you dont want to confuse collaborating partners, for instance.  

** Reflect: Commit Size
* How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By cumulating the modifications until you are happy to commit a logical change

** Reflect: When to Use Branches
* What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you want to develop the code, while at the same time keeping an official version of the code for others (that also may work on different aspects of the code) 

** Reflect: Visualizing with Diagrams
* How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Its useful to know how the branches are branched.  

** Reflect: Merging Two Branches
* What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging combines the codse of two branches, unless there is a conflict. 
Diagrammatic representation shows branching from the same trunk, and merging in terms of branches joined into one trunk, the commits being intertwined by dates.

** Reflect: Automatic vs. Manual Merging
* What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Its not clear how two branches can commit, there will be the human interpretation necessary,  because we have no good way of knowing the intention of which of the cofliting parts of the code is the desired one from the users point of view. Only partially when there is little degree of conflict.
