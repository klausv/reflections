** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When collaborating with others on code development

** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

New versions might have conflicts with the code I am working on, i.e. files that may be used as input to mye code. Thus updating of repositories  should not happen without my conscious approval.  

** Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are clones of repositorie on githb, with link to the owner of the forked repository.  
To be used when building upon others work, and giving them some credit for their work. 

Clones are copies of a repository.  To be used from your own repositories, or your collaborators/employees
Branches are a commits that was separated from the master (a series of commits) in a parallel sequence at a certain commit in the past.
